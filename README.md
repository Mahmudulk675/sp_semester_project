Project Name: AgeMaster

Project Introduction:
AgeMaster is a C-based console application designed to calculate the
age of a person based on their date of birth. The application provides a
simple and efficient way for users to determine their age accurately. By
entering their date of birth, users can quickly obtain their current age in
years, months, and days. AgeMaster aims to be user-friendly, intuitive,
and reliable, making it suitable for a wide range of users.

Functionalities:

Calculate Age: Users can enter their date of birth, and AgeMaster
will calculate their age based on the current date.

Display Age: The calculated age will be displayed in years, months,
and days, providing comprehensive information.

Support for Different Date Formats: AgeMaster will support various
date formats to accommodate user preferences.

Error Handling: The application will handle invalid inputs and
provide clear error messages to guide users.

User-Friendly Interface: AgeMaster will feature a simple and
intuitive console interface for ease of use.

Efficient Calculation: AgeMaster will employ efficient algorithms to
accurately calculate age.

Technologies Used:
